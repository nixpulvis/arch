# My Arch Linux

To facilitate both a sane live image and installed setup, this repoitory
provides `live/` and `install/`. Live creates a unchanging (between restarts)
image that is ideal for USB or CD media, and can be used to install or recover
machines with. Install targets a device and sets up my Arch environmnt.
