# Arch Live

Generally an Arch Live image (ISO) is obtained by simply downloading one from
www.archlinux.org. However, if you want to create an Arch Live image with
custom packages and configurations, then Arch provides an `archiso` package,
which this directory is derived from.

## Usage

```sh
./build
```

## Details

TODO: Explain the important differances between this build and the standard
build.
